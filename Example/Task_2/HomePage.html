                <p> Mountain Expeditions is a small UK company owned and run by Jon Gupta. We specialise in bespoke,

                    <br>
                    A successful expedition is made up of the hundreds of small wonderful experiences gained from start 
                    to finish. We therefore ensure that every aspect of your trip is expertly organised and well-managed.

            <p>We operate in 6 countries. We respect and value the local communities with whom we work and have nurtured and
               built strong relationships with them. As a result, we feel we have a deeper understanding of how to best deliver the trip 
               of a lifetime to you.
